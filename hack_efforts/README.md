# Reverse Engineering

The goal here is to look at save files and try to edit them such that we can tweak our settings. The best thing ever would be if we could take a save file and tweak it so that we have 1000+ cat food. That would be da' bomb.

# UPDATE

There is now no need to reverse engineer (unless you want to do it for fun). Inside the `hackediOS/` folder, there is a pre-hacked iOS version with tons and tons of cat food.
