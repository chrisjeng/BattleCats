# BattleCats
Compilation of PONOS The Battle Cats save files. In order to use a save file, copy the entire `Documents` folder into your own iOS directory. You can do this using iTools (see more on how to splice in files via my other GitHub README's). The most up-to-date file is v 2.1.1 and can be found in the corresponding folder `most_recent_save`.
